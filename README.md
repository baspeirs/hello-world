Repository for Code Kentucky Pre-Work assignment. 

I am Bryce. Graduate of a Coding Bootcamp program through the University of Central Florida and a transplant from the Orlado, Florida area to the Greater Cincinnati Metro.

> My goal here with Code Louisville/Code Kentucky is to immerse myself back into web development after months of unemployment and to build a network with professionals in my area.
> I have worked in tech for about 3 years, plus a couple of years worth of educational and personal project experience which has been spread out between Full Stack Web Development and Robotic Process Automation.
> Outside of software engineering, I have many interests and hobbies which include:
> 
>  - baseball
>  - gaming with my friends
>  - watching movies and tv shows with my spouse
>  - exploring nature and the city
>  - table top games (example: Dungeons and Dragons)
>  - studying history and archeology
>  - listening to and playing music
>  - and more.
